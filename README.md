# Getting Started with Machine Learning
In this workshop, we will
1. Learn what artifical intelligence and machine learning is
1. Learn enough Python to access machine learning tools
1. Develop a machine learning model on a sample problem
1. Discuss what to try next

## Setup Instructions
For this workshop, we recommend installing the <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/" target="_blank">Anaconda Python Distribution</a> which supports Windows, Mac, and Linux. This single all-in-one installer includes:
1. Python
1. Many of the useful data analaysis packages
1. <a href="https://jupyter.org/" target="_blank">Jupyter Notebook</a>, which is the environment we will use in the workshop

All of this will be explained in the workshop. For now, we need you to download and install Anaconda.

### 1. Anaconda Python Distribution

1. Navigate to <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download" target="_blank">https://www.anaconda.com/download</a> with your web browser and download the Python *3.x* installer (e.g. Python 3.10).
2. Run the installer using all the default installation options.

**Note for Linux Users:** *Running the installer requires using the shell, as described [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/#installation).*

3. Test your installation. In windows, you should have `Anoconda Prompt` installed as one of your programs. In linux and mac, you should be able to run `conda --version` in the terminal. 

### 2. Browser Compatibility
The Jupyter Notebook runs in the browser and supports: [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), and [Safari](https://support.apple.com/downloads/safari). Up to date versions of Opera and Edge may also work, but if they donâ€™t, please have one of the supported browsers installed.
